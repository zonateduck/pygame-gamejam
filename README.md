## Description of the game

The topic of the Game Jam was "Fairytale." Since it is such a broad topic, we began our Game Jam journey with a council meeting, where each adventurer presented their ideas on how we would reach our goal. We decided to set out for the great land of Grandma's Forest, where the player embodies a young girl, Iris, visiting her grandma. But, as so often happens in fairytales, doom looms over the land. Colors are disappearing from the world, and Grandma is behaving suspiciously. Iris must embark on a journey across the forest and Grandma's garden to save both the world and her beloved granny. 

Now for the more technical details. The game was created using pygame, and the visuals were all made by us with libresprite and aseprite. The game is run using the game.py file.

NOTE: if the game isn’t working for you, go into the file “assets” in src and replace the path variable to whatever the parent folder is called (or use “.”).
